# Blur Auto Clicker

<p align="center"><em>An accuracy and performance focused auto clicker</em></p>


## Why I made it:

A lot of the most popular auto clickers, like OP Auto Clicker and Speed Auto Clicker, are pretty inaccurate at higher speeds. Setting CPS to 50 might give you 40... or 60. Technically this is not an issue since they are still clicking _fast_, but I am a perfectionist and I wanted something that could actually click at the CPS I set it to, even at higher speeds. So I made this.

Additionally, many auto clickers have 1 good feature but are missing the other features I want. My auto clicker combines all the features I have seen in other auto clickers, and even adds some of my own ideas.

Performance is also a heavy focus of this. While version 3 and onwards run on a web-based UI, The total RAM usage is around 50mb and I intend for it to never go above 100mb.

## Installation

[![Download from GitHub](https://github.com/machiav3lli/oandbackupx/blob/034b226cea5c1b30eb4f6a6f313e4dadcbb0ece4/badge_github.png)](https://github.com/Blur009/Blur-AutoClicker/releases/latest)

Windows:
1. download the `.exe` / installer from releases
2. run the installer
3. launch the app

By default, the program is stored in `%localappdata%/BlurAutoClicker/BlurAutoClicker.exe`.

macOS:
1. download the `BlurAutoClicker-<version>-macOS.zip` from releases
2. unzip it (macOS usually does this automatically in the Downloads folder) and drag `BlurAutoClicker.app` into `Applications`
3. launch the app. macOS will show *"Apple could not verify 'BlurAutoClicker.app' is free of malware"*. This is expected because the build is not signed with a paid Apple Developer ID. Click **Done**.
4. open `System Settings` → `Privacy & Security`, scroll to the bottom, and click **Open Anyway** next to the BlurAutoClicker entry. Authenticate with Touch ID or your password. The app then starts normally on every subsequent launch.
5. if macOS blocks automated clicks, allow the app under `System Settings` → `Privacy & Security` → `Accessibility`.

Prefer the Terminal? You can skip steps 3–4 by removing the quarantine flag once:

```bash
xattr -cr /Applications/BlurAutoClicker.app
```

After that, the app launches without any Gatekeeper prompt.

Config and stats are stored in the platform app data directory:
- Windows: `%appdata%/BlurAutoClicker`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/BlurAutoClicker`

*Info: If you are on version 2.1.2 or below, delete the old executable (the installer will not delete it for you).
The old Config and Stats files will unfortunately not be compatible with the new versions (3.0.0 and above), so they will be deleted upon launching the application.*

### Windows trust / signing

Unsigned GitHub-downloaded Windows installers can still show a SmartScreen warning. Tauri updater signing is separate from Windows Authenticode signing. See [docs/windows-release-trust.md](docs/windows-release-trust.md) for build commands, signature checks, and the release-trust checklist.

## Building From Source

This project is currently Windows-first. The maintained desktop build path is the Rust `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` toolchain plus Node.js.

Requirements:
- Node.js 20 or newer
- Rust via `rustup`
- Microsoft C++ Build Tools / Visual Studio Build Tools

Setup:
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Blur009/Blur-AutoClicker.git
cd Blur-AutoClicker
npm install
rustup default stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
```

Run the app in development:
```powershell
npm exec tauri dev
```

Build a release bundle:
```powershell
npm exec tauri build
```

Useful validation commands:
```powershell
npm run lint
npm run build
cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml
```

The built Windows installer is written to `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/nsis/`.

## Other Info
1. Windows has a limit of around 500 CPS for mouse events. This is because Windows timer resolution is limited to about 1ms at minimum (1000cps) but Windows also needs to do other things, so the practical limit is around 800cps, but since I can not guarantee that performance on every computer, I set the limit to 500cps.
2. On macOS, synthetic mouse input requires Accessibility permission. Without it, the app UI can open normally, but automated clicking may be blocked by the OS.
