# Blur Auto Clicker

<p align="center"><em>An accuracy and performance focused auto clicker</em></p>


## Why I made it:

A lot of the most popular auto clickers, like OP Auto Clicker and Speed Auto Clicker, are pretty inaccurate at higher speeds. Setting CPS to 50 might give you 40... or 60. Technically this is not an issue since they are still clicking _fast_, but I am a perfectionist and I wanted something that could actually click at the CPS I set it to, even at higher speeds. So I made this.

Additionally, many auto clickers have 1 good feature but are missing the other features I want. My auto clicker combines all the features I have seen in other auto clickers, and even adds some of my own ideas.

Performance is also a heavy focus of this. While version 3 and onwards run on a web-based UI, The total RAM usage is around 50mb and I intend for it to never go above 100mb.

- adjustable click timing (duty cycle)
- Speed Range Mode (randomizes CPS within a range)
- Corner and edge stopping (turns off when mouse is in corners or near edges of the screen)
- Click and Time limits (stop after certain amount of clicks or time)
- Double clicks
- Position Clicking (you can pick a position where the mouse will move to and click.)
- Clicks can be adjusted to per Second, Minute, Hour, or even Day
  
Other Features:
- click stats (total clicks, clicks per second, etc)

### Mouse and keyboard targets

Use the Mouse/Key target selector to choose what Blur Auto Clicker sends each cycle. In Mouse mode, pick left, middle, or right click. In Key mode, click the key field and press the key you want auto-pressed.

For letter keys, use the small arrow control next to the key field to switch whether the key is sent as lowercase or uppercase. A large up arrow means uppercase, and a small down arrow means lowercase. Non-letter keys ignore this case control. Right-click the key field to clear the selected key before choosing a new one.

## Installation

      <a href="https://github.com/Blur009/Blur-AutoClicker/releases/latest">
        <img src="https://github.com/machiav3lli/oandbackupx/blob/034b226cea5c1b30eb4f6a6f313e4dadcbb0ece4/badge_github.png" alt="Download from GitHub" height="75">
      </a>
    </td>
  </tr>

By default, the program is stored in `%localappdata%/BlurAutoClicker/BlurAutoClicker.exe`. 

Config and stats are stored in `%appdata%/BlurAutoClicker`.

*Info: If you are on version 2.1.2 or below, delete the old executable (the installer will not delete it for you).
The old Config and Stats files will unfortunately not be compatible with the new versions (3.0.0 and above), so they will be deleted upon launching the application.*

### Windows trust / signing

Unsigned GitHub-downloaded Windows installers can still show a SmartScreen warning. Tauri updater signing is separate from Windows Authenticode signing. See [docs/windows-release-trust.md](docs/windows-release-trust.md) for build commands, signature checks, and the release-trust checklist.

## Other Info
1. Windows has a limit of around 500 CPS for mouse events. This is because Windows timer resolution is limited to about 1ms at minimum (1000cps) but windows also needs to do other things, so the practical limit is around 800cps, but since I can not guarantee that performance on every computer, I set the limit to 500cps.
